<p>Dear {{SupplierContactName}},</p>

<p>
    Thank you for taking the time to register through our invite-only supplier
    onboarding process and for sharing your organisation’s details with us.
</p>

<p>
    Following a review of your submission against our current onboarding scope
    and readiness criteria, we regret to inform you that we are not able to
    progress your organisation to the next stage of onboarding at this time.
</p>

<p><strong>Important Context</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>This outcome relates specifically to the current onboarding phase (V0.1A)</li>
    <li>It is based on present programme scope, capacity alignment, and planning priorities</li>
    <li>This does not represent a negative assessment of your organisation’s capabilities or experience</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Our current onboarding phase is intentionally limited and highly selective,
    focused on near-term readiness requirements for UK-facing delivery planning.
</p>

<p><strong>What This Means for Now</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Portal access will not be enabled</li>
    <li>The Supplier SLA will not be issued for review</li>
    <li>No further onboarding actions are required from your side</li>
</ul>

<p>

    As the TalentedStaff.com ecosystem evolves and onboarding phases expand,
    we may revisit supplier engagement where alignment and requirements permit.
</p>

    We genuinely appreciate your interest, time, and effort in engaging with
    our process, and we thank you for your understanding.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any questions or would like clarification regarding this outcome,
    please feel free to reply to this email and our onboarding team will respond.
